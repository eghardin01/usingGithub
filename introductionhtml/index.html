            <p>Pandas are adorable creatures that just lay around all day.  They will sit up in trees and eat bamboo until they fall out of them, you'd think it would hurt them but they are used to it and their body normally just absorbs the fall.</p>

             <p>The Red Panda is a small creature that has similar qualities to a panda but ends up being more like a racoon rather than a panda.  While pandas are a highly endangered, Red Pandas are less endangered having about 10,000 int the wild whereas there are only about 3,000 Giant Pandas left in the wild.</p>

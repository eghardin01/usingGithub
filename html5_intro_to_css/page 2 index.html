        <h2>Landing on the Moon</h2>

        <main>
            Neil Armstrong stepped on to the surface of the Moon on 20 July 1969. As he did so, he spoke the famous words: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."  A camera was able to transmit the moment to around 650 million people who were watching on television.  Armstrong was closely followed by fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who described the Moon as "magnificent desolation".  They spent 21 hours on its surface, including a seven-hour sleep, before returning to Earth.  About 400,000 people worked on the Apollo 11 mission

            <h3>Man On The Moon</h3>
            Twelve people have walked on Earth's Moon. The first one was Neil Armstrong and the last one was Harrison Schmitt. All crewed moon landings took place between July 1969 and December 1972 as part of the United States Apollo program. All twelve people who have walked on the Moon are American men.   Armstrong had left the US Navy and was already a NASA employee when he and Elliot See became the first civilian astronauts in Astronaut Group 2. Americans alive at the time remember it as the night of July 20, 1969 (Armstrong set foot on the Moon at 10:56 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time), but it was the 21st in UTC.
